Assumption
1. Map Size is only valid between 5-20 [5x5 - 20x20]
2. Strategist path generation:
    - The destination in the path is the grid the player is facing.
    - uses the shortest path generation if the grid the player is facing is not a valid path.

3. Boulder can go through collectable items
4. Monsters can go through collectable items
5. Upon obtaining invincibility potion, our runaway generation is defined by the monster looking at a grid furthest away from the player and recursively run away
6. If Hound is not paired with the hunter, the Hound just uses the shortest path generation.
7. Arrows can go through collectables.
8. If a bomb is exploding, but the player is invincible the player does not die
9. We can have an infinite amount of door key pairs
